<h2>Ordinal Number Line</h2>
Inspired by <a href="http://stephenbrooks.org/archive/ordinals/" Stephen Brook's version />. Controls are the same - up for zoom in, down for zoom out, left and right for panning. Zoom levels are only 1x, 2x, 4x, ..., since others break the program, causing things to appear and disappear.
